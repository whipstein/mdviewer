# MDViewer

A lightweight, native macOS Markdown viewer built for developers.

## Overview

MDViewer was created out of a simple need: a fast, minimal way to read `.md` files when working from the terminal with tools like Claude Code or Codex. It renders Markdown beautifully without the overhead of a browser or a full editor.

MDViewer started as a viewer — but we wanted editing too, so it now includes a built-in split-view editor.

## Features

- **Instant rendering** — opens and renders Markdown files immediately
- **Live reload** — watches for file changes and re-renders as you save
- **Table of contents** — auto-generated sidebar from headings with smooth scroll
- **Syntax highlighting** — 27 languages via [Shiki v1](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki)
- **Math equations** — inline and block LaTeX via [KaTeX](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX)
- **Mermaid diagrams** — flowcharts, sequence diagrams, Gantt charts, and more
- **Smart link handling** — local `.md` links open in-app; external links open in the browser
- **Export to PDF** — one-click PDF export preserving all styles
- **Signed & notarized** — Developer ID signing and Apple notarization

### Editor Mode

Toggle the built-in editor with **⌘E** or the pencil button in the toolbar.

- **Split view**: Editor on the left, live preview on the right
- **Save**: ⌘S saves changes to the current file
- Unsaved changes are indicated by the Save button becoming active
- Closing the window with unsaved changes prompts Save / Discard / Cancel

## Requirements

- macOS 14 Sonoma or later
- Apple Silicon (M1 or later)
