# Changelog

All notable changes to MDViewer will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

---

## [1.2.1] — 2026-08-07

### Fixed
- Enlarged the TOC expand/collapse chevron's click target to a full 22×22 area so it's much easier to click

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-08-07

### Added
- Split-view editor click-to-locate: click any block in the preview to move the editor's caret to that source line
- In-document search (⌘F): highlights every match with a `current/total` counter, steps through hits with ⌘G / ⇧⌘G, and auto-expands collapsed sections when a match is inside one

### Fixed
- Shell/code blocks containing `$…$` (e.g. `echo $FOO and $BAR`) now render literally instead of being parsed as math
- Reload no longer discards unsaved edits: the reload button prompts Save / Discard / Cancel, and the file watcher won't overwrite in-progress edits
- Search now opens and focuses only in the active window instead of every open window

### Removed
- Japanese localization; the app is now English-only

---

## [1.1.2] — 2026-06-14

### Changed
- Internal code formatting only: the entire Swift codebase was reformatted with SwiftFormat to enforce the 4-space indentation convention. No functional or behavioral changes.

---

## [1.1.1] — 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- Local images stored alongside the Markdown file are now rendered correctly. Relative image paths are served through the `mdviewer-local://` scheme handler instead of `file://`, which the WebView sandbox had been blocking (images previously appeared as broken links).

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-22

### Added
- Split-view editor mode: toggle with ⌘E or the toolbar pencil button
- Left editor pane with monospaced text input and live preview on the right
- Save support: ⌘S saves changes to the current file (read-write sandbox entitlement)
- Unsaved-change guard: closing the window with unsaved changes prompts Save / Discard / Cancel

---

## [1.0.3] — 2026-05-05

### Added
- Export: default filename now inherits the source Markdown filename (e.g. `README.pdf` instead of `document.pdf`); percent-encoded characters (Japanese, spaces) are decoded correctly
- Title bar now displays the open filename instead of "MDViewer"

### Removed
- Page thumbnail sidebar removed; TOC sidebar only

---

## [1.0.2] — 2026-05-05

### Changed
- PDF export: replaced `WKWebView.createPDF()` (single-page) with `NSPrintOperation.runModal` to correctly apply print CSS and generate properly paginated multi-page PDFs

### Fixed
- PDF export hang-up resolved by switching to `NSPrintOperation.runModal`
- Sidebar: thumbnail tab temporarily hidden (TOC-only display)

---

## [1.0.1] — 2026-05-05

### Added
- PDF/print layout: `@media print` styles for A4 page size, margins, and page-break control
- Build and notarization script (`build-notarize.sh`)

### Fixed
- Shiki syntax highlighter: added try/catch with fallback and 8-second initialization timeout
- Removed redundant light-theme CSS overrides for Shiki (inline styles take precedence)

---
